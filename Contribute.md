Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following:

* Conform to the format used for other links:
* `[Game](link) - [:package:](link) [:floppy_disk:](link) [:gear:](link) :moneybag: - optional note/comment/description`
* The main game link should go to the official homepage, with the icons providing the portability info.
* Use whichever icons apply, and apply the link directly to the emoji as shown.
* For special cases, I'm open to other solutions.
* Format titles appropriately.
* Briefly state the relevance of your contribution and how you know that it's portable (**NB!**).
* For the above, a reputable link/quote or results from any tests conducted are sufficient.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* If necessary, search previous suggestions before making a new one.
* Place the game under the appropriate category.
* New categories or improvements to the existing categories are welcome.

Thanks for your suggestions!
